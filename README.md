# Ryze Collective Media Group Release

Saturday, 1st February 2024 - v1.0.0

Overview
We are pleased to announce the official launch of the Ryze Collective Media Group website. This platform showcases our diverse range of artists and services, including Reflex Interactive, RTK+, and Ryze VFX Films. The website offers detailed information about our artists, services, and music. We are committed to keeping this site updated with the latest developments and information. Additionally, we are working to bring our other associated websites online, with an anticipated completion date between the end of 2025 and mid-2026. We are also developing a mailing list to provide you with convenient updates on select content.

Homepage
Upon visiting the website, you will be greeted with an introduction to Ryze Collective Media Group and a summary of our mission and values. The navigation bar (accessible at the top of the page) will adapt to your device, whether you're using a PC, Mac, or mobile device, but the links, title, and logo remain consistent across all pages for easy navigation. The homepage also features information about our artists and services. In addition, a contact form is available for any inquiries, bug reports, or general questions. A footer, which appears on every page, contains copyright information and links to our legal policies and contact details.

Artist Page
Clicking the "Artists" link in the navigation bar will direct you to a dedicated section for our artists. From there, you can access the "Our Artists" page, which provides an overview of all the artists currently signed to RCMG (as of 01/02/24, 02/01/25 for US readers). Each artist is featured with a brief biography and a link to their full profile page.

Individual Artist Pages
By selecting an artist from the "Our Artists" page or the homepage, you will be taken to their individual profile page. Here, you can learn more about the artist, including links to their website (if applicable), biography, and music. If approved by the artist and staff, a photograph of the artist will be displayed; otherwise, a requested image will appear in its place.

Services
Our service pages mirror the structure of the individual artist pages, offering detailed information about the services provided by Reflex Interactive, RTK+, and Ryze VFX Films.

We are dedicated to ensuring that this website, along with our associated platforms, remains up-to-date and consistently styled to meet the highest standards.
