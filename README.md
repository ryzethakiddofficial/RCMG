Patch Notes: v1.1 – February 4th, 2025

Hello everyone, this is Ryan Duncuft, CEO of Ryze Collective Media Group (RCMG). I'm pleased to announce the release of version 1.1 of our platform. This update brings several important improvements and fixes to enhance the user experience across all devices.

UI & Responsiveness Improvements One of the major changes in this update is the significant improvement to the user interface and responsiveness, particularly for mobile devices. We’ve carefully optimised the design to ensure that the platform now looks sleek and works seamlessly across all screen sizes and devices. Whether you’re browsing on a smartphone, tablet, or desktop, you’ll notice a smoother, more polished experience.

Bug Fixes As part of our ongoing efforts to provide a smooth and reliable service, we’ve addressed and fixed a few bugs that were impacting the platform. Notably, the issue where artist logos were displaying as greyed out has now been resolved. We’ve also tackled various graphical bugs, ensuring that the visuals now appear as intended and without any glitches.

Redesigned "Our Artists" Page We’ve also made improvements to the "Our Artists" page, which now presents all the artists signed to us in a more organised and visually appealing layout. The artist cards have been redesigned for a cleaner, more modern look, making it easier to navigate and find your favourite talent.

This update is just the beginning, and we remain committed to continuously improving the platform. Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements in the future!

Thank you for your support and continued feedback. We’re excited to keep building a platform that you love.

Best regards,
Ryan Duncuft
